Using your previous HW code, we develop an application code of the cannonball shooting. The program should follow the flowchart:

https://tulane.instructure.com/courses/2165899/assignments/13476042




Your code must have:

Develop a function takes a <strong>Projectile</strong> object, a target position , and a time step,           , computes the projectile, and returns the difference between the landed position and the target position,     .

The target position must be               . Throw exception if not satisfied.

The initial speed must be                                     . Throw exception if not satisfied.

The initial angle must be                                    . Throw exception if not satisfied.

The target is determined to be destroyed if                             , where  is the landed position.

Use your “<strong>ProjectileWithDrag</strong>” class to create a object.

You can define the weight of cannonball and the drag coefficient as you like.
